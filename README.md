==Hailboards 3==

Hailboards 3 will be the third edition of the Hailboards phpBB theme system. We will be migrating the Hailboards system to be just a theme (as hailboards 2.0b currently is); our goal is to maintain an the project up-to-date with phpBB 3.x's latest version. Listed below are the goals and aims of the project migration from the 2.x branch to the 3.x branch.

* Complete redesign of all assets to be HTML5 compliant.
* Full documentation suite for customised Hailboards editing.
* Migrating away from the use of Trel's usercolour mods (to a better solution).
* Portability with a built-in Mobile theme.
* Lightweight, easy-to-ready code.

Our project has the following milestones:

* Hailboards Redesign
* Code implementation
* Beta Testing
* Release

We are currently seeking volunteers for the project! If you would like to help in any way please contact us and let us know.
